   LOS ANGELES _ Religion-motivated hate crimes rose more than 34
percent in Los Angeles County last year, driven largely by copycat
incidents after the North Valley Jewish Community Center shooting
rampage, according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of hate crimes rose 11.7 percent across the
county last year, to 859, the second-highest figure in 20 years,
according to the Los Angeles County Human Relations Commission
report.
</P>
<P>
   There were 137 religion-motivated crimes, including 118 _ or 86
percent _ directed against Jews, the report says. In 1998, Jews
were the target of 86 out of 102 religious hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The growth in anti-Semitic hate crimes is closely tied to the
Aug. 10, 1999, shooting spree at the North Valley Jewish Community
Center, officials said during a news conference. Buford O. Furrow,
a self-described white supremacist from Washington state, is
accused of the rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attack in Granada Hills resulted in copycat incidents,''
said David Lehrer, western regional director of the Anti-Defamation
League.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of anti-Semitic incidents, California and Los Angeles
County are bucking the national trend. Over the past five years
nationally, we've had a 25 percent decrease in anti-Semitic
incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   While the overall crime rate has declined nationally and in Los
Angeles, the study found hate crimes continue to rise. The highest
number of hate crimes _ 995 _ was reported in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the San Fernando Valley, hate crimes rose 22 percent, from
169 in 1998 to 206 last year, according Police Department
statistics released in January.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to stem hate crimes include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A $450,000 county program that focuses on the communities
hardest hit by hate crimes, and a new commission Web site that will
provide information about anti-hate resources and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   _ A District Attorney's Office program to rehabilitate juveniles
who commit hate crimes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Legislation that calls for better reporting of hate crimes by
schools and law enforcement agencies and the formation of a
statewide human relations commission.
</P>
<P>
   _ The county Human Relations Commission has sponsored
conferences, launched a public information campaign, funded
community groups and developed a human relations curriculum for
schools.
